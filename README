ABOUT
     dsbdriverd is a daemon that automatically tries to find and load the
     suitable driver for your PCI and USB hardware. On startup dsbdriverd
     scans the PCI and US(B) bus for all connected devices and looks up their
     driver in a database using information provided by the hardware. The same
     applies to USB devices attached to the system later at runtime.

INSTALLATION
           # git clone https://github.com/mrclksr/DSBDriverd.git
           # cd DSBDriverd && make install

USAGE
     dsbdriverd [-fnu] [-x driver, ...]

OPTIONS
     -f      Run in foreground.

     -l      List installed devices and their corresponding driver.

     -n      Just show what would be done, but do not load any drivers.

     -u      Start dhclient(8) on Ethernet devices that appeared after loading
             the corresponding driver.

     -x      Exclude every driver in the comma separated list from loading.

SETUP
     In oder to start dsbdriverd at boot time, add the following line to
     /etc/rc.conf:

           dsbdriverd_enable="YES"

     In addtion you can specify flags using the dsbdriverd_flags variable. If
     you want dsbdriverd to automatically start dhclient(8) on your Ethernet
     devices for which it loaded the corresponding drivers, you can set

           dsbdriverd_flags="-u"

     in /etc/rc.conf
